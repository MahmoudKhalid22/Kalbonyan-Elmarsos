### Course details
- GitHub is the industry-standard tool for collaborating on and sharing code. Itâ€™s popular among software developers, project managers, designers, and students for its flexibility and control. This course introduces GitHub and Git, the version control system that GitHub is built upon. Instructor Aaron Stewart, a training content specialist at GitHub, explains the benefits of version control, how to navigate GitHub and the command line, how GitHub and Git are related, and the best practices for communication and collaboration on GitHub. Aaron also reviews the most common tasks, such as branching, commits, and pull requests, and shows you how to create a simple local project and move it to GitHub to share with your team.
